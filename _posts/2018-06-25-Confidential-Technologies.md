With the friendly support of TU Braunschweig, [Confidential Technologies GmbH](https://www.cotech.de) was founded by Vincent Breitmoser, Leif Scheppelmann and Dominik Sch√ºrmann.
Our company provides professional support for OpenKeychain and develops custom end-to-end encryption products.

### OpenPGP/Autocrypt Library
We are currently in the process of developing an OpenPGP/Autocrypt library based on the OpenKeychain codebase.
It will be available as a GPLv3 version for other Free Software projects, but also under a commercial license to be used in proprietary projects.
It can be used in your Android apps, but also in other Java-based software, for example desktop or server applications.
For inquiries, please [contact us](https://www.cotech.de/contact/).

### Consulting
Confidential Technologies offers a range of consulting services for security research and development.
We provide professional support for OpenKeychain and consulting services for the design and implementation of real-world cryptographic protocols.

Contact us to integrate OpenPGP or Autocrypt in your app.
